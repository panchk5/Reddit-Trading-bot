# Reddit-Trading-bot
This fun little project scrapes HTML data from the "meme" financial subreddit "Wallstreetbets" to find the most referenced tickers and uses those tickers to trade stocks using the Alpaca API. My goal is to determine if public opinion on stocks constitutes good investment advice. To get this working download a chrome webdriver and replace my path with yours in the main.py. Also, create your alpace trading account and copy the API key and secret. Not everything is fully functional yet. Im working on refreshing the stocks every month and hosting my results on an HTML website.
